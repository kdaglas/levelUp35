This is an app for issuing event tickets.

### Assignment three
---------------------------

Imagine you are at an event reception desk; when someone arrives to attend, you are charged with checking if a user registered for the event and in which category.

Given two text files, one containing names of people who registered for the event in the VIP category and the second contains those that signed up for ORDINARY tickets.

Your program should:
- Read the files, and store the contents in lists.
- Ask a user to enter one of their names and check through the lists to see
    > if a user paid for a ticket
    > if the ticket paid for, is an Ordinary or Vip ticket

Specs:
> Name your main function registration_checker, its argument/input should be a single name
> For example; For the name Maria, it should return a Full name, Category i.e Maria Nanfuka, VIP
> For the name Edison, it should return Not Registered
> Put your file (reception.py) in an importable folder named reception within the project directory.

** Your Git and Pivotal Tracker usage is of a high priority (edited)
